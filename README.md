Ducument Scanner

The scanner takes a scanned image, finds the corners of the document, applies the perspective transformation to get a top-down view of the document,
sharpens the image, and applies an adaptive color threshold to clean up the image.

On my test dataset of 280 images, the program correctly detected the corners of the document 92.8% of the time.
